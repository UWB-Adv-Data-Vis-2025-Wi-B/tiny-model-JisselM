## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a dataset collected on crickets.

```{r load data, include=FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound? 

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate. 

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") + 
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

Summary:

Number of observations: 31
Number of species: 2
Temperature range: min of 17.20, max of 30.40
Mean rate of chirping: 72.89
